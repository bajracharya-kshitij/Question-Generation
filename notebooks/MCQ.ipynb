      "Instead, they form a supercooled liquid, a metastable liquid phase that exists below the normal melting point. A cooling curve is not exactly the reverse of the heating curve because many liquids do not freeze at the expected temperature. The conversion of a solid to a liquid is called fusion (or melting). The energy required to melt 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus). Plots of the temperature of a substance versus heat added or versus heating time at a constant rate of heating are calledheating curves. All phase changes are accompanied by changes in the energy of a system. A superheated liquid, a liquid at a temperature and pressure at which it should be a gas, is not stable. Heating curves relate temperature changes to phase transitions. Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always exothermic. The direct conversion of a solid to a gas is sublimation.\n",

      "Instead, they form a supercooled liquid, a metastable liquid phase that exists below the normal melting point. A cooling curve is not exactly the reverse of the heating curve because many liquids do not freeze at the expected temperature. The conversion of a solid to a liquid is called fusion (or melting). The energy required to melt 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus). Plots of the temperature of a substance versus heat added or versus heating time at a constant rate of heating are calledheating curves. All phase changes are accompanied by changes in the energy of a system. A superheated liquid, a liquid at a temperature and pressure at which it should be a gas, is not stable. Heating curves relate temperature changes to phase transitions. Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always exothermic.

      "For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks and pipes can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or magnesium (Figure 17.18). The more active metals (lower reduction potential) are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode (oxidize) at the anode. Thus, even if the zinc coating is scratched, the zinc will still oxidize before the iron. Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more active metal. Zinc-plated or galvanized iron uses a different strategy. This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. For example, stainless steel is mostly iron with a bit of chromium. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen necessary for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it forms an oxide layer that protects the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the iron is protected from corrosion.\n",

    "text3 = \"One way to keep iron from corroding is to keep it painted. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen necessary for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the iron is protected from corrosion. Other strategies include alloying the iron with other metals. For example, stainless steel is mostly iron with a bit of chromium. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it forms an oxide layer that protects the iron. Zinc-plated or galvanized iron uses a different strategy. Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential. Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more active metal. Thus, even if the zinc coating is scratched, the zinc will still oxidize before the iron. This suggests that this approach should work with other active metals. Another important way to protect metal is to make it the cathode in a galvanic cell. This is cathodic protection and can be used for metals other than just iron. For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks and pipes can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or magnesium (Figure 17.18). This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. The more active metals (lower reduction potential) are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode (oxidize) at the anode. The metal being protected serves as the cathode, and so does not oxidize (corrode). When the anodes are properly monitored and periodically replaced, the useful lifetime of the iron storage tank can be greatly extended.\"\n",
